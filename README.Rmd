`datefixR` standardizes dates in different formats or with missing data: for
example dates which have been provided from free text web forms.

There are many different formats dates are commonly represented with: the order
of day, month, or year can differ, different separators ("-", "/", ".", or
whitespace) can be used, months can be numerical, names, or abbreviations and
year given as two digits or four. `datefixR` takes dates in all these different
formats and converts them to R's built-in date class. If `datefixR` cannot
standardize a date, such as because it is too malformed, then the user is told
which date cannot be standardized and the corresponding ID for the row.
`datefixR` also allows the imputation of missing days and months with
user-controlled behavior.

`datefixR` also supports dates provided in different languages and provides
translated warning and error messages. The following languages are currently
supported:

* English
* Français (French)
* Deutsch (German)
* español (Spanish)
* Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)
* Pусский (Russian)

Not familiar with R or want to quickly try out `datefixR`? Check out the shiny
app [here](https://nathansam.shinyapps.io/datefixr/).

## Installation instructions

`datefixR` is now available on CRAN.

```{R Cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("datefixR")
```

The most up-to-date (hopefully) stable version of `datefixR` can be installed
via [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/)

```{R dev, eval = FALSE}
# Enable universe(s) by ropensci
options(repos = c(
  ropensci = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
))

install.packages("datefixR")
```

If you wish to live on the cutting edge of `datefixR` development, then the
development version can be installed via

```{R, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/datefixR", "devel")
```

## Package vignette

`datefixR` has a "Getting Started" vignette which describes how to use this
package in more detail than this page. View the vignette by either calling

```{R, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes("datefixR")
```

or visiting the vignette on the [package
website](https://docs.ropensci.org/datefixR/articles/datefixR.html)

## Usage

`datefixR` is most commonly used to standardize columns of date data in a data
frame or tibble. For this demonstration, we will use an example toy dataset
provided alongside the package, `exampledates`.

```{r example}
library(datefixR)
data("exampledates")
knitr::kable(exampledates)
```

We can standardize these date columns by using the `fix_date_df()` function and
passing the data frame/tibble object and a character vector of column names for
the corresponding columns to fix.

```{R}
fixed.df <- fix_date_df(exampledates, c("some.dates", "some.more.dates"))
knitr::kable(fixed.df)
```

By default, `datefixR` imputes missing days of the month as 01, and missing
months as 07 (July). However, this behavior can be modified via the `day.impute`
or `month.impute` arguments.

```{R}
example.df <- data.frame(example = "1994")

fix_date_df(example.df, "example", month.impute = 1)
```

Functions in `datefixR` assume day-first instead of month-first when day, month,
and year are all given (unless year is given first). However this behavior can
be modified by passing `format = "mdy"` to function calls.

Numeric representations of dates, as used by either Excel or by R, are also
supported. 

```{R}
fix_date_char("19539")
fix_date_char("45108", excel = TRUE)
```

## Limitations

Date and time data are often reported together in the same variable (known as
"datetime"). However datetime formats are not supported by `datefixR`. The
current rationale is this package is mostly used to handle dates entered via
free text web forms and it is much less common for both date and time to be
reported together in this input method. However, if there is significant demand
for support for datetime data in the future this may added.

The package is written solely in R and seems fast enough for my current use
cases (a few hundred rows). However, I may convert the core for loop to C++ in
the future if speed becomes an issue.

## Similar packages to datefixR

### `lubridate`

[`lubridate::guess_formats()`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/guess_formats.html)
can be used to guess a date format and
[`lubridate::parse_date_time()`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_date_time.html)
calls this function when it attempts to parse a vector into a POSIXct date-time
object. However:

1.  When a date fails to parse in `{lubridate}` then the user is simply told how
    many dates failed to parse. In `datefixR` the user is told the ID (assumed
    to be the first column by default but can be user-specified) corresponding
    to the date which failed to parse and reports the considered date: making it
    much easier to figure out which dates supplied failed to parse and why.
2.  When imputing a missing day or month, there is no user-control over this
    behavior. For example, when imputing a missing month, the user may wish to
    impute July, the middle of the year, instead of January. However, January
    will always be imputed in `{lubridate}`. In `datefixR`, this behavior can be
    controlled by the `month.impute` argument.
3.  These functions require all possible date formats to be specified in the
    `orders` argument, which may result in a date format not being considered if
    the user forgets to list one of the possible formats. By contrast,
    `datefixR` only needs a format to be specified if month-first is to be
    preferred over day-first when guessing a date.

However, `{lubridate}` of course excels in general date manipulation and is an
excellent tool to use alongside `datefixR`.

### `anytime`

An alternative function is
[`anytime::anydate()`](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/anytime.html) which
also attempts to convert dates to a consistent format (POSIXct). However
`{anytime}` assumes year, month, and day have all been provided and does not
permit imputation. Moreover, if a date cannot be parsed, then the date is
converted to an NA object and no warning is raised- which may lead to issues
later in the analysis.

### `parsedate`

`parsedate::parse_date()` also attempts to solve the problem of handling
arbitrary dates and parses dates into the `POSIXct` type. Unfortunately,
`parse_date()` cannot handle years before 1970 -- instead imputing the year using
the current year without raising a warning. 

```{R}
parsedate::parse_date("april 15 1969")
``` 

Moreover, `parse_date()` assumes dates are in MDY format and does not allow the
user to specify otherwise. However, `{parsedate}` has excellent support for
handling dates in ISO 8601 formats. 

### `stringi`, `readr`, and `clock`

These packages all use
[ICU library](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/datetime/)
when parsing dates (via `stringi::stri_datetime_parse()`, `readr::parse_date()`,
or `clock::date_parse()`) and therefore all behave very similarly. Notably, all
of these functions require the date format to be specified including specifying
a priori if a date is missing. Ultimately, this makes these packages unsuitable
when numerous dates in different formats must be parsed.

```{R}
readr::parse_date("02/2010", "%m/%Y")
```

However, these packages have support for weekdays and months in around 211
locales whereas `datefixR` supports much fewer languages due to support for
additional languages needing to be implemented individually by hand.


### Speed comparison

These alternative packages all use compiled code and therefore have the
potential to be orders of magnitude faster than `datefixR`. However, in my own
testing, I found `{anytime}` to actually be slower than `datefixR`: consistently
being over 3 times slower (testing up to 10,000 dates).
`lubridate::parse_date_time()` (which is written in R) is an order of magnitude
of time faster than `datefixR` and `lubridate::parse_date_time2()`, which is
written in C but only allows numeric dates, is even faster. If you are don't
mind not having control over imputation, do not expect to have to deal with many
dates which fail to parse, are confident you will specify all potential formats
the supplied dates will be in, and you have many many dates to standardize
(hundreds of thousands or more), `{lubridate}`'s functions may be a better
option than `datefixR`.

If speed is an absolute priority and limited control over date parsing is
acceptable, then  `stringi`, `readr`, and `clock` are all excellent choices as
they are around 10<sup>5</sup> times faster than `datefixR`.
